# Theme - Mariana Plus

[Mariana](https://github.com/n0rmand0/Mariana-Pro-color-theme) theme for Sublime Merge 2.

This implementation of Monokai uses the Sublime Merge Theme as a template with the Mariana color palette.

## Install

Assuming the required color scheme is installed, git clone the project or download it into your Sublime Merge `Packages`
folder as `Mariana Theme`. Edit your merge `Preferences.sublime-settings` file to use the Mariana theme:

```
    "theme": "Mariana Plus (Cool).sublime-merge-theme"
```
